            <h1>😁 Beaming Face with Smiling Eye  </h1>
            <p>A yellow face with smiling eyes and full-toothed grin, as if saying Cheese! for the camera. Teeth may be 
                smoothed-over or crosshatched. Often expresses a radiant, gratified happiness. Tone varies, including warm, 
                silly, amused, or proud.  </p>

                A yellow face with a slight smile shown winking, usually its left eye. May signal a joke, flirtation,
                 hidden meaning, or general positivity. Tone varies, including playful, affectionate, suggestive, 
                 or ironic.

                 floating around its head. Expresses a range of happy, affectionate feelings,

                  by platform.
